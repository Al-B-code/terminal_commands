# A Git Cheatsheet for Beginners
---
# What is Git?
Git is an open-source version control system that allows for the tracking of changes that can later be recalled. 

By using Git individuals that are contributing to a project can branch off from the main branch which allows them to safely make modifications without fear of permenantly overwriting and breaking the source code.

Once they have made their modifications they can review and merge back into main. If the program breaks there is no need to worry as prior versions would have been saved and can be reverted back too if necessary.

# What is GitHub
Github is often used in parallel with Git. **However, they are not the same thing!** In fact GitHub's name is derived from the fact that the most largely used version control system is **Git**.

*Essentially, GitHub is a hub that leverages the Git technology, hence it's name!*

## 1. Git Basics
- To initialise a Git repository: `Git init`
- Clone a repository: `Git clone [repository URL]`
- View commit history: `Git log`

## 2. Committing Changes
- Stage changes: `Git add [file(s)]`
- Commit changes: `Git commit -m "Commit message"`
- View commit history: `Git log`

## 3. Branching and Merging
- Create a new branch: `Git branch [branch name]`
- Switch to a branch: `Git checkout [branch name]`
- Merge branches: `Git merge [branch name]`
- Delete a branch: `Git branch -d [branch name]`

## 4. Remote Repositories / Synchronising Changes
- Add a remote repository: `Git remote add [remote name] [remote URL]`
- Push changes to a remote: `Git push [remote name] [branch name]`
- Amend the last commit: `Git commit --amend`
- Pull changes from a remote repository: `Git pull [remote name] [branch name]`


## 5. Undoing Changes
- Discard changes in workin directory: `Git checkout -- [file(s)]`
- Unstage changes: ` Git reset [files(s)]`
- Create and switch to a new branch: `Git checkout -b [new branch name]`


## 6. Conflict Resolution
- To resolve merge conflicts using Git, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Your Repository is Up-to-Date:** Fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository to your local branch.

2. **Initiate the Merge:** Use `Git merge` or `Git pull` to start the merge process. Git will pause if conflicts occur.

3. **Identify Conflicts:** Git marks conflicting lines in files with special markers.

4. **Manually Resolve Conflicts:** Edit the conflicted files to choose which changes to keep and remove conflict markers.

5. **Add the Resolved Files:** Stage the modified files with `Git add`.

6. **Commit the Merge:** Use `Git commit` to commit the resolved changes with an appropriate message.

7. **Push the Changes:** If working with a remote, push the merged changes to the remote branch.

8. **Clean Up:** Optionally, delete feature branches or perform any necessary post-merge tasks.

## 7. Gitignore
- It is a configuration file used in Git to specify which files and directories should be ignored and not tracked by the version control system. 

- It allows you to exclude certain files or patterns from being added to the Git repository.

1. **Ignoring Sensitive Information:** You can use Gitignore to exclude files that contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or private configuration settings.

2. **Excluding Build Artifacts:** Build processes often generate files and directories that are not meant to be versioned, such as compiled code, log files, or temporary build files.

3. **Avoiding OS or IDE-specific Files:** Gitignore can be used to exclude files and directories specific to certain operating systems or IDEs, like .DS_Store on macOS or .idea/ for JetBrains IDEs.

4. **Minimizing Repository Size:** By ignoring unnecessary files, you can reduce the size of your Git repository, making cloning and fetching faster and more efficient.

>To create a .gitignore file for your project, you can create a new file named .gitignore in the root directory of your Git repository and specify the patterns and filenames you want to ignore. 
>It's a good practice to commit the .gitignore file to your repository to ensure that other collaborators follow the same rules for ignoring files.
---

**Below is an example .gitignore file.**

```
# Ignore compiled code
*.class
*.jar

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore directories generated by IDEs
.idea/

# Ignore macOS-specific files
.DS_Store

# Ignore sensitive information
config/secrets.yml
```

- *.class and *.jar will ignore all compiled Java class and JAR files.
- *.log will ignore all log files.
- .idea/ will ignore the entire .idea/ directory, typically used by IntelliJ IDEA.
- .DS_Store will ignore macOS-specific metadata files.
- config/secrets.yml will ignore a specific file containing sensitive data.

## 8. Hosting On GitHub

1. **Create a Repository on GitHub:**

- Sign into GitHub.
- Click the "+" sign in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
- Fill out the repository name, description, and other settings.
- Ensure you are using a SSH key for Git as it is more convenient and secure.
- Choose whether to make it public or private.
- Click "Create repository."

2. **Initialise a Local Git repository:** 
- create local Git repository by navigating the desired directory for your project.
> Make sure to avoid making a local repository inside of another repository as that can cause errors and problems in the future when branching and merging.
```
Git init
```

3. **Link the Local Repository to the GitHub Repository:**
 - After creating the repository on GitHub, it needs to be linked with your local Git repository.

 ```
  Git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.Git
 ```
4. **Push Your Local Repository to the GitHub Repository**
- To upload your local repository to the GitHub repository, use the following:
```
Git push -u origin main
```
>This pushes your local main branch to the origin remote on GitHub. If you're working with a different branch, replace main with the branch name.
>>The -u (or --set-upstream) option in the Git push command is used to establish a tracking relationship between a local branch and a remote branch. When you use -u, you're essentially telling Git to remember the relationship between your local branch and the remote branch, making it easier to push and pull changes in the future.
>>
>>Git will remember that your local main branch corresponds to the main branch on the origin remote. After this, you can simply use Git push or Git pull without specifying the remote and branch name. Git will use the tracking information to determine where to push and pull changes.
>>
>>In summary, the -u option is a convenient way to set up a tracking relationship between your local branch and a remote branch, streamlining future push and pull operations. It's particularly useful when working with remote repositories where you frequently push and pull changes.

Now, your local Git repository is linked to the GitHub repository using the "main" branch, which is more aligned with current best practices for branch naming. You may need to authenticate with your GitHub credentials during the first push or pull operation.


## 9. Git Workflow

1. **Initialise a Repository**:
   - Create a new Git repository for your project using `git init`, or clone an existing repository using `git clone`.

2. **Branching**:
   - Create a new branch for each new feature, bug fix, or task using `git branch`.
   - Switch to the newly created branch using `git checkout`.

3. **Development**:
   - Make changes to your code within the branch.
   - Use `git add` to stage your changes, and then commit them with `git commit`.

4. **Regular Commits**:
   - Make frequent and meaningful commits that capture the progress of your work. Each commit should have a clear message describing the changes made.

5. **Pulling Updates**:
   - Regularly fetch and merge the latest changes from the main branch (usually `master` or `main`) to keep your branch up-to-date with the latest code using `git pull`.

6. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - If there are conflicts between your changes and the main branch, resolve them by editing the affected files and then committing the resolved changes.

7. **Code Review**:
   - Request code reviews from your peers to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

8. **Merging**:
   - Once your changes are approved and the branch is up-to-date, merge it into the main branch using `git merge` or create a pull request (in platforms like GitHub or GitLab) and have it reviewed and merged there.

9. **Tagging and Release**:
   - After successfully merging your changes into the main branch and ensuring everything is stable, create a tag to mark a specific version or release of your software using `git tag`.

10. **Pushing Changes**:
    - Push your local branch and tags to the remote repository using `git push` to share your work with other team members.

11. **Cleanup**:
    - Delete the feature branch (if no longer needed) to keep your repository clean and organised using `git branch -d` or `git branch -D` if the branch hasn't been merged.

12. **Repeat**:
    - Continue working on new features or bug fixes by starting the process again with a new branch.


## 10. Beginner-Friendly Git Tips and Best Practices


1. **Set Your Identity:**
   - Configure your name and email address using `git config` so that Git knows who you are.

2. **Create a Repository:**
   - Use `git init` to create a new Git repository in your project folder.

3. **Add and Commit Changes:**
   - Use `git add` to stage your changes and `git commit` to save them with a descriptive message.

4. **Ignore Files:**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository to specify files and folders that should not be tracked by Git.

5. **Check Your Status:**
   - Use `git status` or `gst` to see the current status of your repository, including untracked files and changes to be committed.

6. **Branches Made Simple:**
   - Understand that branches are like separate copies of your project. Use `git branch` to see the available branches and `git checkout` to switch between them.

7. **Remote Repositories:**
   - Learn about remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab) where you can store your code online.

8. **Clone a Repository:**
    - Use `git clone` to make a copy of a remote repository onto your computer.

9. **Pull Changes:**
    - Before making changes, always use `git pull` to get the latest updates from the remote repository.

10. **Push Your Changes:**
    - After committing your changes, use `git push` to send them to the remote repository.

11. **Collaborate with Pull Requests:**
    - If working with others, use pull requests (on platforms like GitHub) to propose and review changes.

12. **Merge vs. Rebase:**
    - Understand that merging combines changes from different branches, while rebasing can make your history more linear.
>Merge:
>
>>Combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new "merge commit."
Preserves the branching history and shows when and how different features or fixes were integrated.
Useful for collaboration when a shared history is important.

>Rebase:
>
>>Integrates changes by replaying the commits from one branch on top of another.
Creates a linear, cleaner-looking history with the appearance of sequential changes.
>>
>>Useful for keeping a tidy commit history when working on personal branches or preparing clean pull requests.
>>
>>In essence, merging maintains a more detailed history, while rebasing keeps a cleaner and more linear history. The choice between them depends on your project's or team's preferences and guidelines.

13. **Undo Mistakes:**
    - Learn how to undo changes using `git reset` and `git revert` if you make a mistake.

14. **Backup Your Work:**
    - Consider using cloud-based services or external backups to safeguard your code.
